An edit to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation#Legendre_transformation_on_manifolds">section</a> of the Wikipedia article on the Legendre transformation.

The Legendre transformation is used in Physics to translate between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of classical mechanics. Physics textbooks typically define this transformation explicitly, using coordinates.
This is not completely satisfactory, since any given system can be described with a myriad of different coordiante systems.

The edit expands on the coordiante-free description of the Legendre transformation using the language of modern geometry.
